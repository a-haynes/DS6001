There is an advanced web scraping problem here: we can't use `BeautifulSoup` because the download URL does not appear in the source HTML code for the website. We can use selenium, an alternative and more aggressive web-scraping package that connects with web browsers on your machine to extract exactly what appears on the screen. However that's beyond our scope today as we are focusing on databases. For now, be prepared to update the URL every few hours if you are going to develop this project.\n",
