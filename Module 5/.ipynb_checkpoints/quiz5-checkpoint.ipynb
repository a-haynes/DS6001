    "Data science is a new field, especially compared to long-established academic disciplines like physics, mathematics, and medicine. So it is a lot harder to know the landscape of important journals, programs, and conferences. At the UVA School of Data Science, we are hoping to send our faculty, staff, and students to more conferences to learn cutting edge developments in the field, build a wider network, recruit new students and faculty, and get the word out about our school. One issue is that the phrase \"data science\" is still very trendy and that makes it difficult to know worthwhile conferences from ones that are sort of scammy. We are working to build out a comprehensive database on data science conferences. But before we take on the challenge of collecting all of the data ourselves, we need to see what databases already exist.\n",
